# Chatbot üí¨
In this project I Identified an operational inefficiency, recognizing the over-reliance on interns for customer service and proposing an AI-driven solution to optimize human resources. Therefore I optimized resource allocation and reduced manual workload by developing an NLP-powered chatbot to handle frequently asked customer inquiries, automating responses and improving efficiency. This chatbot is trained on a company's FAQs. The purpose of this is chatbot is to simply help companies answer their FAQs on customer service quickly. This helps them automate services as well as automate monotonous manual tasks.
